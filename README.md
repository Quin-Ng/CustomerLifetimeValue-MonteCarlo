# Customer Lifetime Value estimation using Monte Carlo simulation
Using Monte Carlo simulation in Excel to estimate Customer Lifetime Value to determine whether to acquire new customers or retain existing customers.

**Scenario:**

A big supermarket store manager is looking to estimate the probability whether retaining existing customers by offering them regular discounts will increase profitability. 

The store manager believes that the annual revenue generated by a single customer is between £150- £270 and the annual customer costs is £110.

The store manager would like to compare gross lifetime value over a four-year period with the cost of acquiring new customers which is £145.

This way the store manager would learn whether it is worthwhile to acquire new customers or retain existing customers. 

In Addition, the store manager assumes that the initial number of customers at the beginning of this year period will be 250 aiming to keep the retention rate between 30-45% by offering them a discount rate between 35-40%.

Multiplier based on 52 weeks and loyalty value is £147.

The number of iterations for Monte Carlo simulation is 2500.

**Tasks performed:**
- Calculate the multiplier based on 52 weeks and loyalty value.
- Calculate Gross Lifetime Value
- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value
- Implement Monte Carlo simulation.
- Create histogram chart to summarise simulation results

**Results:**
- Gross Lifetime Value is £234.0
- Customer Lifetime Value is £280.36
- Average Customer Lifetime Value from Monte Carlo is approximately £219.12 with 75% probability.
- Histogram shows that CLV ranges from £71 to £359 with insignificant variation in frequency (around 145 to 180), except for the group of customers that generates the highest CLV (£359 to £383) that has the lowest frequency of around 49.

**Key takeaways:**
* Cost of acquiring customers vs. Annual customer cost:

The cost of acquiring new customers (£145) is larger than the annual customer costs (£110).

However, it's important to note that this cost represents the annual customer costs rather than the cost of retaining a single customer over a four-year period.

Therefore, a direct cost comparison between customer acquisition and customer retention cannot be made based on the provided information alone. It would require additional data on the cost of retaining existing customers over a four-year period.

* Average CLV vs. Cost of acquiring new customers:

According to the Monte Carlo simulation results, the average customer lifetime value over a four-year period is estimated to be £218.14.

Comparing this value with the cost of acquiring new customers, which is £145, indicates that the estimated customer lifetime value is higher than the cost of acquisition. 

This suggests that **focusing on customer retention may be more beneficial** in terms of generating **long-term value** compared to acquiring new customers.


**Recommendations:**

**1. Prioritize Customer Retention:** 

Since the estimated customer lifetime value (£218.14) exceeds the cost of acquiring new customers (£145), it suggests that focusing on customer retention is likely to be more beneficial. 

By offering regular discounts to existing customers, the store can incentivize them to remain loyal and continue generating revenue over the long term.

**2. Implement a Targeted Discount Strategy:** 

Instead of offering regular discounts to all customers, consider implementing a targeted discount strategy. 

High-value customers are more likely to generate significant revenue over time. Offer personalized discounts or loyalty programs to these customers, as it can provide a higher return on investment compared to blanket discounts for all customers.

**3. Monitor and Optimize:** 

Continuously monitor and analyze the impact of customer retention strategies on profitability. 

Track key metrics such as customer churn rate, customer lifetime value, and overall revenue. 

Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the discount programs and make adjustments as necessary to maximize profitability.
