# Customer Lifetime Value estimation using Monte Carlo simulation
Using Monte Carlo simulation in Excel to estimate Customer Lifetime Value to determine whether to acquire new customers or retain existing customers.

**Scenario:**

A big supermarket store manager is looking to estimate the probability whether retaining existing customers by offering them regular discounts will increase profitability. 

The store manager believes that the annual revenue generated by a single customer is between £150- £270 and the annual customer costs is £110.

The store manager would like to compare gross lifetime value over a four-year period with the cost of acquiring new customers which is £145.

This way the store manager would learn whether it is worthwhile to acquire new customers or retain existing customers. 

In Addition, the store manager assumes that the initial number of customers at the beginning of this year period will be 250 aiming to keep the retention rate between 30-45% by offering them a discount rate between 35-40%.

Multiplier based on 52 weeks and loyalty value is £147.

The number of iterations for Monte Carlo simulation is 2500.
